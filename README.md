# fruits-data-set
It is a project in which there are 7 attributes and 58 tuples of data are present.
I used the library scikit-learn to predict the type of fruit.
There are basically 4 kinds of fruits present in the data apple,lemon,mandarin and orange.So prediction of which kind of fruits is done.
